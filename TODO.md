# TODOs

- Use a [more realistic](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) app as example to showcase async server side actions.
- Finish `Dockerfile` and document it.
- [Push Docker image to a registry as part of CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/).
- Add script to compile `server.ts` instead of `ts-node`.

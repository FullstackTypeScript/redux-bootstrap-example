# TODOs

- Enable HMR with SSR.
- Use a [more realistic](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) app as example to showcase async server side actions.
- Finish Dockerfile and document it.
- [Push Docker Image to a Registry as part of CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/#Pushing-a-Docker-Image-to-a-Registry).
- Add script to compile `server.ts` instead of `ts-node`.
